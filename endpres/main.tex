\section{Motivation}

\begin{frame}{The Board}
\pause
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Designed for developing
% comes with instructions for android and linux. android preinstalled
\pause
 \item Cortex-A9-based
% 1 GHz, single-core\\
\pause
 \item Freescale i.MX6-architecture
% SOC for mm-applications\\
\pause
 \item Co-processing power
% chips for decoding x264, 2d- and 3d-graphics\\
\pause
 \item Many different interfaces
% USB, eth, sound, HDMI, Display-Port, dev-stuff like JTAG, UART
% Can boot from internal memory, or SD-card
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why Do We Want This?}
% RIOT-OS is not known for it's need to run on phones.
% With i.MX6-support RIoT-OS could be used for 
\pause
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Automotive 
% automotive,\\
\pause
 \item Industrial 
% industrial,\\
\pause
 \item Handheld consoles
% handheld consoles,
\pause
 \item Easy developement
% easy developement->This often is underestimated. Most microprocessors are
% painful to target for developing. The RIoTboard is aimed at developers: You
% can have different programs on the board itself or on several SD-cards.
% Flashing can be done to either targets via USB or directly to an SD-Card
% without having to destroy the data on the partitions (after some preparation).
% The fully-developed program can probably be used for any other i.MX6-board
% without too many modifications, if any (maybe IOMux brrrrrrrrrrr).
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Our original idea of how to do shit}
\begin{frame}{Initial Work-Model}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Assess the situation
% This was easy. Many documents.
\pause
 \item Try running anything on the board
% We have to documents from the manufacturer: One is a schematic and the other
% is specification for the hardware with instructions on flashing either the SD
% -card or the internal eMMC (micro-SD they forgot somehow) with ubuntu or android.
% Glad there were instructions for this.
\pause
 \item Run our own code
% After having realised that we wouldn't be able to flash the ROM, we tried
% going through u-boot and loaded just a main() onto the board.
\pause
 \item Get a framework to run
% We wanted to use u-boot but the IOMux-configuration would then have been
% fixed and it is usually a bad idea to change that (what RIoT would have
% ultimately done). Plus, the teaching staff convinced us that the i.MX6-SDK
% is much nicer. Somehow, we have got a working framework.
\pause
 \item Split to work on different components individually
% Even though we could, in theory, start getting specific hardware to work
% with RIoT-OS, there is a significant problem.
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Achievements}

\begin{frame}{The Original Plan:}
% from the orinal slides:
\pause
 \begin{itemize}
 \item UART I/O for debugging and shell communication
% uart. erm. problems. everything set up, but no cigar\\
\pause
 \item Timer(s) so the kernel can run
% timers are running by default, but not yet usable by RIoT (or in fact: the
% UART)\\
\pause
 \item Interrupts
% interrupts are enable, but no implementation for interface to RIoT\\
\pause
 \item Set up a stack
% set-up stack, done (works nicely due to the SDK)\\
\pause
 \item Build it successfully (probably the hardest part :-) )
% This worked after about a month
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unfinished Work}
% The slide should rather be called "The One Big Problem" because there is this
% one thing that is really bugging us:
\pause
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The UART
% We tried the default configuration from the SDK, diy-UART-init, inserted
% adapted u-boot-code, tried configs for other boards and made some ourselves
% with the IOMux-config-tool from the SDK which generates headers with register
% -definitions and macro-implementations.\\
\pause
 \item Timers
% Then there is timers
\pause
 \item Interrupts
% and interrupts\\
 \end{itemize}
% but with the only working debugging facilities being to LEDs, this is a
% rather terrifying task
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Interference}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Going from u-boot to SDK
% This was initially a drawback because it took us significantly longer to
% integrate the SDK than it would have with u-boot(mainly because the board-
% specific code from u-boot is squeezed into just 4 source-files.
% But after the make-process of the SDK was integrated into RIoT-OS it was
% really easy to adjust the start-process. So by then we were early.
\pause
 \item The UART initialisation process
% Nuff said on that.
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Future Tense}

\begin{frame}{Plans}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Try altering IOMux-configurations for other boards
% Other IOMux-confs might offer insight on what is going wrong
\pause
 \item JTAG-debugging
% Avoid the UART-related problems to allow getting to work on other components
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
