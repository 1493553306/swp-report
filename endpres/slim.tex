% Were porting to the RIoTboard. You probably know us by now...
 \end{frame}

\section{Motivation}

\begin{frame}{Context}
 \begin{itemize}
% also commonly known as: META-stuff-slide
 \item what do we want?
 \begin{itemize}
 \item RIoT-OS running on the RIoTboard
% because, why not?
 \item have fun coding
% who doesn't?
 \item fancy hardware
% thank you (for the hardware)
 \item credit points
% why wouldn't we?
 \end{itemize}
 \item what did we expect to achieve?
 \begin{itemize}
 \item get the hardware for free
% because that's the only real reason to join a telematics-project
 \item basic support of the RIoTboard for RIoT-OS
% just because these names go really well together..
 \item be motivated enough to continue working on the port after the software-project
% seems like it's far more interesting than "deytabeysis" + plus we can keep the board for as long as we are working on it
 \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Task-Division}

\begin{frame}{Task-Division}
% aka "boring slide"
 \begin{itemize}
 \item sub-goals:
% we had help planning the steps before the project even started
 \begin{itemize}
 \item gather relevant documents
% if only we had read them also...
 \item find out how on the board "works"
% we asked for the hardware early and having the board and a linux-port really helps
 \item build a basic application that runs on the board (LED-blinking)
% get something to run
 \item build this application from within RIoT-OS (run our program from the \texttt{board\_init})
% build "something" the RIoT-style
 \item enable interrupts
% interrupts are enabled
 \item UART for STDIO
% stdio is somehow nice to have
 \item implement timer-interface
% there are two....
 \item wiki pages
% have wiki pages in our github-fork
 \end{itemize}
 \item milestone arrangement
% these points really don't make sense in any other order
 \item milestones have dates assigned
% the team urged us not to try to do too much and we were very conservative with the dates
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Milestones}
% these are the milestones
 \begin{itemize}
 \item get familiar with the board
 	\begin{itemize}
 	\item boot it, read manuals and documentation
 	\item try features with existing OS that supports it
 	\item understand target architecture
 	\item flash it
 	\item cross-compile
 	\item be able to actually run bare-metal code
 	\end{itemize}
 \item find out what needs to be done for a port
 	\begin{itemize}
 	\item identify re-useable code
% |let them read a bit|
% identify re-useable code: we tried to use the u-boot-port and ... panic mode! \\
 	\item learn about interfaces in RIoT
% learn about interfaces in RIoT: skipped this and ran straight to adjusting the code of the SDK
 	\end{itemize}
 \item port it
 	\begin{itemize}
 	\item patch SDK for use in RIoT
 	\item successfully build
 	\item debug
 	\end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Outcome}

\begin{frame}{Outcome}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item all goals reached
% but..
 	\item spaghetti
% we have working code that is in an "interesting" state
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problems - documentation}
% or: did everything work as expected?
% short answer - as with every project: no (or nöööö)
% while gathering documents we were expecting something like a straight-forward
% memory-map like we were used to from the micro-processor-lab
 \begin{itemize}
 \item expectation: to turn on the LED write a bit to \$beef1337:3
% warning: the ugliness of these slides depicts the ugliness of having to find out these things the hard way
 \item reality:
 	\begin{itemize}
 \item i.MX6-reference-manual
 		\begin{itemize}
 \item the status of a GPIO-pin is determined by a bit in a register that can be anywhere - based on the configuration of the muxer
 \item names of channels in the muxer are from the same namespace as the functions mapped onto them
 		\end{itemize}
 \item RIoTboard-schematics
 		\begin{itemize}
 \item one LED on the RIoTboard is connected to a function "EIM\_DATAwx" \textcolor{light-gray}{which you can then map GPIOyz on}
 		\end{itemize}
 	\end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problems - reference code}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item embest-tech doesn't supply a muxer-configuration-file that can be used with the SDK
% which is kinda sad. They have targeted mainly android development and a bit of linux
 \item maybe looking at how they did it for their u-boot- and linux-ports helps?
% is spaghetti. we don't dare think about how our code would look like if be based it on spaghetti.
 \item reconsideration: the i.MX6-platform-SDK has macros to abstract to and from the muxer config
% which you can only use if you have valid configuration file which in turn can only be created and generated code from with a windows-only-tool
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problems - different abstractions}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The platform-SDK differentiates between code concerning
% then there is a problem of different abstractions in the SDK and in RIoT
 	\begin{itemize}
 	\item the i.MX6-architecture
% CPU, interrupt-controller
 	\item peripherals
% driver for UART and timers (which in RIoT belong to the CPU) or ethernet and USB
 	\item board-specific headers and iomux-configuration
% iomux-configuration, register definitions (depending on the kind of i.MX6 - SL - SDL - D)
 	\end{itemize}
 \item RIoT has its own abstraction for each of those (dividing the sub-topics differently)
% We should we include the SDK ?
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Demo}
DEMO (of \texttt{printf}s and flashing LEDs)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{PRs}
% At the time of writing we have one failed, a successful and another pending pull request:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \#1355 was closed in favour of \#1359 \textcolor{light-gray}{Leon had trouble keeping the git-log tidy}
% This would have allowed using LD for linking by changing the global Makefile and the
% Makefile of any board not using LD (so far: all except the RIoTboard).
 \item \#1359 was merged - with the help of staff members and RIoT-maintainers.
% This basically does the same as \#1355 but leaves other Makefiles untouched and
% assuming GCC to be used by default. Boards using LD have to explicitely supply a
% variable.
 \item \#1411 is still pending and we do not know whether it will be merged.
% It's purpose is to bring the software-project to a conclusion and add support for
% the riotboard and the i.MX6-SDK.
% This contains hundreds of file from the SDK that have been altered to just work.
% (obviously not fit for rolling out)
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Future}

\begin{frame}{Perspectives}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item still motivated
 \item perhaps scrap the existing code and restart
% restart in two weeks of time
 \item or: clean the existing code
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Questions?}
