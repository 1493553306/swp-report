internal-boot:
"MMC/SD/eSD/SDXC/eMMC can be connected to any of USDHC-1,2,3,4 blocks and can
be booted by copying 4Kbyte of data from MMC/SD/eSD/eMMC device to internal
RAM. After checking the Image Vector Table header value (0xD1) from Program Image,
the ROM code performs a DCD check. After successful DCD extraction, the ROM code
extracts from Boot Data Structure the destination pointer and length of image to be
copied to RAM device from where code execution occurs." p.416
"The boot ROM code reads application image length and
application destination pointer from image."

This is meta-data that is copied on boot. It contains information such as pointers to instructions
