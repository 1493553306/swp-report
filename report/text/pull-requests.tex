\section{pull requests}

At the time of writing we have one failed, a successful and another pending pull request:
\begin{itemize}
\item \#1355 was closed in favour of \#1359. Leon had trouble keeping the git-log tidy.
This would have allowed using LD for linking by changing the global Makefile and the
Makefile of any board not using LD (so far: all except the RIoTboard).
\item \#1359 was merged - with the help of staff members and RIoT-maintainers.
This basically does the same as \#1355 but leaves other Makefiles untouched and
assuming GCC to be used by default. Boards using LD have to explicitely supply a
variable.
\item \#1411 is still pending and we do not know whether it will be merged.
It's purpose is to bring the software-project to a conclusion and add support for
the riotboard and the i.MX6-SDK.
\end{itemize}

Despite the struggles during the work so far we remain motivated to continue on this
port.
THIS GOES TO ANOTHER TEX FILE:
Should we ever do another project we will focus more on maintaining a clean codebase than
on adding as much functionality at once.
