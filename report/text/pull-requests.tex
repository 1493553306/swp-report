\section{pull requests}

Until the end of the software-project we made these pull requests:
\begin{itemize}
\item \#1355 was closed in favour of \#1359. Leon had trouble keeping the git-log tidy.
This would have allowed using LD for linking by changing the global Makefile and the
Makefile of any board not using LD (so far: all except the RIoTboard).
\item \#1359 was merged - with the help of staff members and RIoT-maintainers.
This basically does the same as \#1355 but leaves other Makefiles untouched and
assuming GCC to be used by default. Boards using LD have to explicitely supply a
variable.
\item \#1411 is still pending and will probably not be merged.
It's purpose is to bring the software-project to a conclusion and add support for
the riotboard and the i.MX6-SDK.
\item \#1452 revises \#1411 by moving most of the big files into packages. This is also not merged but is a lot cleaner and should suffice for finishing the software project.
\item \#1462 addresses a mistake in the template for packages that need to download files via HTTP and is not yet merged.
\end{itemize}
