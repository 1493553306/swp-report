\section{TODO}

This section of the report is about steps that should be taken not only to finish the sofware-project but also have a port that can be merged.

These are the steps which should be considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item move files from the packages back into boards/riotboard and cpu/imx6
\item remove headers and iomux-config for components that will not be used
\item strip the remaining header files of macros, bitmasks and -offsets
\item fix license-headers of remaining untouched source-files or adjust check.sh to tolerate the BSD-style licenses
\end{itemize}

Because there are about twenty register-files for each variant of the i.MX6 and they contain thousands of lines of code we decided not to do those as for the software-project itself.
