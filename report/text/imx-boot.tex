\section{Booting the i.MX6}

While trying to find a simple way of flashing the ROM of the cortex-A9 we learned that
freescale does not want anybody to flash the CPU directly. Instead there is a program on
the ROM that checks hardware-signals called \textbf{FUSE}s to decide how the CPU boots.
Essentially, they allow to boot from one of four \textit{USDHC}-block-devices or a
serial-download-mode. In theory, \textbf{FUSE}s can be used to change other
parameters for booting.

In case of the RIoTboard the first three \textit{USDHC}-lines are 4 GB of internal eMMC,
the SD- and the $\mu$SD-card-slot. The serial interface is wired to the mini-USB-port
next to the ethernet-port and UART2-pins.
Slightly more-detailed information can be found in the gitlab-repository mentioned in
the introduction (\textit{$briefings/boot-switches\_and\_-modes$})

\section{Running our own Software}

The simplest thing we could get to run on the RIoTboard was u-boot: Either via the serial
connection, where the freshly transferred u-boot and an initramfs could be used to
receive files or binary that could then be stored on the board, or by writing the binary
onto a SD-card. From within the running u-boot it was possible to execute a method from
a cross-compiled object-file that simply returned an integer value.
There also is a brief step-through for building u-boot and in the repository for this
port (\textit{$briefings/build\_and\_run\_with\_uboot\_from\_sd-card$}).

We were trying to figure out how to use u-boot for booting and supplying the standard
library but all the files were spread all over the u-boot-source-directory.
As we were realising how difficult it was going to be to not only have a functional
binary based on our own code but also integrate the existing structure into the
make-system of RIoT-OS, we didn't think we would be able to meet any goal beyond
supplying a rudimentary framework so that coding can start in the RIoT-OS-codebase.

By then we were behind schedule as we could not get anything to run that was not built
on top of and run from within u-boot.
