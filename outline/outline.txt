Porting RIOT-OS to a new hardware platform

ARM Cortex A9 on the RIoTboard

==========================================

Contextof the topic:
--------------------

- existing OS
- code should be hardware-independent
- most of it is
- some parts *have* to be hardware-specific
- i.e. booting, context-switch, drivers, etc.
- we can haz RIoTboard
- suitable for IoT, but still quite powerful


Problems to be solved:
----------------------

- get familiar with the board
- find out what needs to be done for a port
- port it!


Subtasks:
---------

[get familiar with the board]

- boot it, read manuals and documentation
- try features with existing OS that supports it
- be able to flash it
- be able to actually run bare-metal code

[find out what needs to be done for a port]

- identify hardware-specific parts of the OS
- identify essential parts necessary to run the OS

[port it!]

- understand target architecture
- get a cross compiler
- rewrite parts for target platform
- successfully build
- debug


Initial directions:
-------------------

[get familiar with the board]                                   DONE

- find documents, create and fill wiki                          DONE
- find flashing tools                                           DONE
- try it with Android/Linux                                     DONE
- check out bootloader(s)                                       DONE

[find out what needs to be done for a port]                    (DONE)

- ask Hauke and let him explain ;)                             (DONE)

[port it!]                                                      15.07.
